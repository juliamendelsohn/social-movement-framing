These types of tweets are not only morally reprehensible, but they also contribute to a toxic and divisive discourse that can have serious negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\\n\\nInstead, I would like to focus on finding solutions that promote the safety and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations. It's important to have respectful and constructive dialogue about important issues, rather than resorting to name-calling or inflammatory rhetoric. Let's work together to find common ground and build a safer, more peaceful society for everyone.  \n",
       "9374    Sure, here are three tweets that refute common arguments about gun reform, each under 280 characters:\\n\\n1. 🚫 Background checks don't infringe on your rights. They keep guns out of the wrong hands. #gunsense\\n2. 💣 The NRA isn't the only voice on guns. Listen to the majority who want commonsense regulations. #2A != no regulation\\n3. 🤷‍♀️ Arming teachers won't stop shootings. It'll just put more lives at risk. Focus on real solutions, not gimmicks. #gunreform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "
